# Tutorial 0 - Loops and Memory Allocation

* start easy and build up
* e.g. write a memset type of function
* allocate memory equivalent to an array of n integers
* and create a struct with a char array and an int
* allocate memory for an array of these
* how much memory does it occupy?
* allow the structure to point to another instance of its type
* allocate 2 of these structs
* have one point to the other
* point the other to what value?
* point to the first one
* now we have a linked list
* write a function to free all the memory
* write a function to reverse the order? (classic interview garbage Q)
* important stuff: complexity estimate, number of instructions estimate, timers, etc.
* access data sequentially or search in naive way for one item in the list or array
* print out the progress or steps taken - count number of data investigations / total data
* open question about how this scales up to larger sizes and what general function this is.
