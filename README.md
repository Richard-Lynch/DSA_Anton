# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Tutorial Requests

* Optimisation approaches
* Tools
  * Profiler
  * Debugger
  * Valgrind

## Interesting Side-Topics (to maybe look at)

* SIMD, SPMD etc and close-to-assembly intrinsics
  * intrinsics not portable between CPU brands
  * algorithm optimisations can be tedious
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgaQCg-0ZoU
* other parallelism and asynchronous computing
* lead-ins or intros to other topics
  * large-scale compute and cloud
  * computational science
  * micro-controller programming
  * AI
  * graphics (obv)
  * ML - guest lecture?
  * networking
