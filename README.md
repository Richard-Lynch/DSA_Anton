# Data Structures & Algorithms
notes, demos, slides
work in progress

## Demos

Some sort of visual demos of different ideas in action.
Is WebGL a good tool to do this? Or would it be better to have some exemplar C code and Makefiles etc...

## Practical Exercises Ideas

* Getting all the tools set up properly, especially the basic ones.
* Basic data structures. Arrays, matrices (2d arrays). Memory layouts.
* Fundamentals of memory, addresses, pointers. Heap and stack.
* Searching
* Sorting e.g. write a ... algorithm
* Measuring and estimating different peformance and cost aspects
* Good coding habits learned by measuring hidden-ish costs of bad ones.

## Twitter Responses

["hey programming professionals! what do you wish graduates knew about data structures and algorithms? i'm making a new course. please RT."](https://twitter.com/capnramses/status/752905320326950912)

* *the practical application of the concept that I am learning*. - Jitesh Mulchandani ‏@mjitesh  Jul 12
* *i wish they knew the difference between data/algos that fit in L1$, in L2$, L3$, RAM, HDD, cloud* - bmcnett ‏@bmcnett  Jul 12
* *I agree with everyone else that my exp with data structs was memorising for interviews; focus on playing around with stuff to actually get an understanding of benefits, pitfalls, etc. Get people to make mistakes! Also cache coherency :)* Kevin (Caoimhín) ‏@GamedevKevin  Jul 12
* *I saw a talk by Mike Acton recently about what he wished new game engine programmers knew. I will try to find the link.* -David Rappo ‏@DavidRappo  Jul 12
* *Are you planning to cover concurrent data structures and algorithms in your new course?* - David Rappo ‏@DavidRappo  Jul 12
* *Access patterns & cache effects, perf. wrt set size, memory usage, what to use and when, think about complexity vs maintenance* - Keith O'Conor ‏@keithoconor  Jul 12
* *How to measure how much time / space something takes and not just showing me the first solution they found on StackOverflow.* - Zachary Snow ‏@smack0007  Jul 12
* *Seriously, just getting them to use big-O thinking for more than just passing your test would be a win.* Sean W. ‏@sean_of_w  Jul 12
* *That when you write nested loops, I cringe before rewriting your code because production fell over.* Sean W. ‏@sean_of_w  Jul 12
* *Also: That most database indexes are really just clever binary trees, and thus have binary-tree performance* Sean W. ‏@sean_of_w  Jul 12 characteristics.
* *That you need more data structures than just "array" and "brand X database server."* Sean W. ‏@sean_of_w  Jul 12
* *Algorithmic analysis and Big-O most important.*
