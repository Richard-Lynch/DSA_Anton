"hey programming professionals! what do you wish graduates knew about data structures and algorithms? i'm making a new course. please RT."

Jitesh Mulchandani ‏@mjitesh  Jul 12
@capnramses the practical application of the concept that I am learning.

@mjitesh @capnramses i wish they knew the difference between data/algos that fit in L1$, in L2$, L3$, RAM, HDD, cloud

Kevin (Caoimhín) ‏@GamedevKevin  Jul 12
@capnramses I agree with everyone else that my exp with data structs was memorising for interviews; focus on playing around with stuff to actually get an understanding of benefits, pitfalls, etc. Get people to make mistakes! Also cache coherency :)

David Rappo ‏@DavidRappo  Jul 12
@capnramses I saw a talk by Mike Acton recently about what he wished new game engine programmers knew. I will try to find the link.

David Rappo ‏@DavidRappo  Jul 12
@capnramses Are you planning to cover concurrent data structures and algorithms in your new course?

Keith O'Conor ‏@keithoconor  Jul 12
@capnramses Access patterns & cache effects, perf. wrt set size, memory usage, what to use and when, think about complexity vs maintenance

Zachary Snow ‏@smack0007  Jul 12
@capnramses How to measure how much time / space something takes and not just showing me the first solution they found on StackOverflow.

Sean W. ‏@sean_of_w  Jul 12
@capnramses Seriously, just getting them to use big-O thinking for more than just passing your test would be a win.
@capnramses That when you write nested loops, I cringe before rewriting your code because production fell over.
@capnramses Also: That most database indexes are really just clever binary trees, and thus have binary-tree performance characteristics.
@capnramses That you need more data structures than just "array" and "brand X database server."

@capnramses Algorithmic analysis and Big-O most important. @uberalex
