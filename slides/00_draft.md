* what is the fundamental task of a computer program?

* fundamental task of a computer program
  - transform data from input form to output form
  - algorithms formalise ordered transformation steps
  - data is structured by us to
    - help algorithm
    - represent input or output formats
    - make it easier to understand
    - perform better w/respect to computer hardware

* what are current graduates bad at?
  - interviews
  - computer science fundamentals
  - understanding hardware
  - low-level programming techniques
  - data

* why?
  - very broad range of software development skills
  - risk of very thin layer (not deep enough knowledge)
  - over-engineering
  - post-dot com era abstraction/"top-down" thinking
  - dependent on libraries/frameworks made by others
  - hours of experience

* goals of course
  1. beef up low-level programming competency
  2. practical knowledge of fundamental DS&A
  3. knowing /when/ and /why/ to introduce complexity
  4. finding the simplest solution
  5. formal analysis techniques
  6. optimisation and practical tools

-------------------------------------------------------

First assignment/lab
--------------------
- self-assessment survey
- settings up compile environment with C
- memory allocation and looping over arrays
  + timers and simple analysis
- formal report/summary of program
- .c file
- grading rubrik similar to berkeley's
